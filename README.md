# python-api-challenge
note that i screwed up and accidentally published an api key.  i deleted that repo which had 5 commits to this.

The project covers a wide swath of things which we have learned, asking us to pull data from multiple api's, cleaning and organizing it,
 visualizing it, both on maps and in plots, and using basic techniques to discover relationships with it.  
 
 Analysis is not terribly complicated and the weather results are what you would expect.
 
 Finding the hotels in the cities with my requisites was fun.
